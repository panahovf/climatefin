### Structure:

1. Script 1 --- identifies emissions intensity factors for fossil fuel power & extraction sectors. This data provides global power & extraction plant level emissions & production details.
   
2. Script 2 --- converts outputs from NGFS scenarios into emissions and compares them to global carbon budgets.

3. Script 3 --- uses NGFS projections' growth rates and applies them to current actual plant level data to adjust projected emissions.

4. Script 4 --- since NGFS pathways are not entirely aligned with global carbon budgets, this identifies 'reduction factors' required to increase pace of phase-out.

5. Script 5 --- is a case study for Poland.
